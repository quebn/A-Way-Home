Tiled is a robust, powerful 2d map editor, and it's totally free!
You can download it here: https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled

The sample map in this folder is "_gentle forest sample map.tmx"
All the ".tsx" files are the tilesets.
One for each sheet (48x48 resizes not included).
I have already setup the autotiled terrains and water animations for each one.

When you load up the sample map, you might see a bunch of red exes, instead of a map.
If this happens, you need to individually select each tileset at the top, click "locate file", and tell Tiled where the file is located on your PC.

Please look at the Tiled documentation (there's even a Tiled Discord server) if you need help figuring anything out.

Once you've made a map, you can import it into your engine of choice.
There are Tiled importers for RPG Maker, Unity, GMS, and Godot, that I know of.
Just Google "tiled importer *your game engine here*"!
